## Features

- Very minimal and fast.
- Commands to add **bold**, _italic_, and tables.
- Hotkeys to add **bold**, and _italic_.
- Autocomplete of list items.
- Code style matches Prettier formatting.
- Doesn’t pollute the editor with too many commands and hotkeys.

## Commands

You can either run this commands from the Command Palette (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on a Mac, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on Windows), or use hotkeys.

| Description | Name | Default Mac | Default Windows |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Toggle emphasis (italic) | `miniMarkdown.toggleEmphasis` | <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> |
| Toggle strong emphasis (bold) | `miniMarkdown.toggleStrongEmphasis` | <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> |
| Insert a table | `miniMarkdown.insertTable` |  |  |

> [!TIP]  
> To insert a link in Markdown, copy the URL to the clipboard, select the text you want to link, and paste.

## Settings

You can [redefine the keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings) for the commands above.

## Changelog

The changelog can be found on the [Changelog.md](./Changelog.md) file.

## How is it different from other extensions?

Most Markdown extensions are bloated with commands and hotkeys I’d never need. In Mini Markdown I added only commands that I either use very often (like bold or italic), or can never remember the correct syntax (like tables). Other tools (like list autocomplete) make the writing comfortable.
